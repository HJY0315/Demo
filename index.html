    <h1>Best Chicken Rice Recipe</h1>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S3UJD08RrFQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>     <p>This is our entry for Jamie Oliver's Search for a Food Tube Star with Uncle Ben's competition. If you're a Singaporean, there's NO CHANCE that you wouldn't know our iconic dish - Chicken Rice.</p>
    <p>We all know that Gordon Ramsay came to Singapore a couple weeks back to compete with our local hawkers, and this dish being one of the competing dishes, became our inspiration to pay tribute to the man himself. ????</p>   
    <p>With all the days of research done on the ultimate chicken rice, this is our tribute, done THE F WORD STYLE, to Gordon Ramsay. Enjoy</p>
